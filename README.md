# terraform-aws

Let's figure out from scratch how to do 'git-ops' to an AWS environment. This needs to include: 

1. Setting up environment variables held as secrets in Git
2. Running Terraform plan
3. Running Terraform apply
4. Setting up a shared S3 backend to hold terraform state
5. Deploying something like a serverless rust function
6. Running terraform destroy
